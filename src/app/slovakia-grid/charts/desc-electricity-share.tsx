        <strong>Nuclear power</strong> forms the backbone of Slovakia's
        electricity mix, generating about <strong>18 TWh</strong> in absolute
        terms and <strong>60%</strong> in relative terms of worth of
        electricity. Slovakia operates two plants - Bohunice and Mochovce.

        The deployment of <strong>renewables</strong> is accelerating. However,
        as of 2025 Slovakia doesn't operate large scale wind or solar farms.{" "}
        <strong>Solar power</strong> accounts for about <strong>2%</strong> of
        the electricity mix, with installations predominantly rooftop-mounted

        Slovakia shut down its last <strong>coal plant</strong> Vojany in 2024.
        The remaining electricity still generated from coal comes from heating
        plants. <strong>Gas power plants</strong> complement the energy mix with
        approximately <strong>9%</strong> of total generation, primarily serving
        as flexible CHP plants or for industrial processes in the case of
        Slovnaft.
